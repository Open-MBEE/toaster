# Deferred work

## D-001: Ch9 satisfy-coverage uses to_api_json() workaround

`model.query()` does not return `SatisfyRequirementUsage` elements (Open-MBEE/OpenSysML#TBD).
Ch9 `01-requirement-coverage.ipynb` uses `model.to_api_json()` and filters for
`@type == 'SatisfyRequirementUsage'` as a workaround.

The workaround is encapsulated in `src/toaster/query.py::get_satisfy_relationships(model)`.
Notebook cells call that function; the workaround does not appear in notebook code.

**Resolution:** When upstream fix ships, update `get_satisfy_relationships()` and the opensysml-api skill.

## D-002: Custom theme / CSS for site

SA-5 sets default book-theme, no custom CSS, for the first release.
Custom theming improves aesthetics and brand alignment but is deferred to avoid
maintenance burden unrelated to learning outcomes in v0.1.

**Resolution:** After v0.1 ships, design a MyST theme extension or custom CSS override.
**Toaster issue:** Open-MBEE/toaster#TBD (update after filing)
